Model files for two types of non-human primate neurons used in the paper: simplified 
versions of 1) a GPi neuron and 2) a GPe axon collateralizing in GPi en route to STN. 
Additional files for simulating the response of these cells to deep brain stimulation 
can be requested by contacting the authors.

GPi neuron model (implemented from tracing in Fig4, Parent2001, J Comp Neurol)
GPe axon model (implemented from tracing in Fig5, Sato2000 J Comp Neurol)
